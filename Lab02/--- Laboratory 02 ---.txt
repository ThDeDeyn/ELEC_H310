--- Clock ---

Question 1: 366 Hz

Question 2: A frequency of 23997 is equivalent to 1ms. A general expression would be f = timeFreq / 23997 [ms] 

Question 3: sends a true value every 1ms 

Question 4: first is coded, second -> use Cydelay ? 

Question 5: 1 period will take 100 iterations of timeclock to be produced -> frequency is divided by  100

Question 6: signal vary from -1 to 1, if I add 1 : from 0 to 2. Finally, multiply by 255/2

Question 7: To improve quality ? Make the signal smoother ("lissage")

Question 8: Interrupt is synched with the timer ? (Jsp) 

Question 9: Some values are cleared when ReadStatus is used (Which one ? )
